# DataScienceFinalProject

In this project I am analyzing the data Netflix has collected on my viewing history from 7/30/2016 to 4/9/2022
I am first counting the number of things watched everyday within this time frame and combining it with weather data, the day of the week,
and then the month for every date recorded with the Netflix file. This then allowed me to analyze any patterns within my viewing habits 
and allowed me to develop classification models on this data. Highlighting what big tech companies can learn about a person based on the data they collect on you.

To run this project I had to use an API to get the weather data colleceted from my home town which then used a personal access key which is read from two files 
that I havent uploaded to this public github repo for security reasons.

I hope you enjoy looking through this project of mine and that it causes you to think about the data you are giving about yourself to big tech companies.

Thanks,
George
